## Step 7: Test the Integration

### Manual Test
1. Go to the "Manage Buildings" tab in admin
2. Find a building that meets your auto-post conditions
3. The building will be automatically posted when:
   - New images are uploaded
   - Building status changes to "Available"
   - Building appears in inventory sync

### Check Posted Buildings
- Posted buildings are tracked to prevent duplicates
- Check your Facebook Page to see the posts
- Posts include the building image (if available) and custom message

## How Auto-Posting Works

The system automatically posts buildings to Facebook when:

1. **New Building Added:**
   - When inventory syncs and a new building appears
   - Building meets all configured conditions

2. **Images Uploaded:**
   - When you upload photos to a building
   - If "Only post with images" is enabled

3. **Status Change:**
   - When a building's status changes to "Available"
   - If "Only post available buildings" is enabled

4. **Conditions Checked:**
   - New inventory only (skips repos if enabled)
   - Has uploaded images (if enabled)
   - Status is "available" (if enabled)
   - Not previously posted

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid OAuth access token"
- Your token has expired
- Generate a new long-lived Page Access Token (Step 4)
- Update it in the admin panel

### "Permissions error"
- Make sure you granted all required permissions in Step 4
- Regenerate the token with correct permissions

### Posts not appearing
- Check that auto-posting is enabled
- Verify buildings meet all configured conditions
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Page ID and Access Token are correct

### "This feature is not available right now"
- Your app may not be approved for posting
- Go to App Review in Facebook Developer Console
- Request permissions: `pages_manage_posts`

## Security Notes

- Never share your Access Token publicly
- The token is stored in localStorage (client-side only)
- Consider using environment variables for production
- Rotate your token periodically

## Rate Limits

Facebook has rate limits:
- ~200 posts per hour per user
- ~600 posts per day per app
- The system prevents duplicate posts automatically
